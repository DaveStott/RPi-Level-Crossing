RPi-Level-Crossing
==================

Python code for Raspberry Pi Level Crossing Project

For my first attempt at this project I have used used 2 stepper motors, a bunch of coloured LEDs, a push to make switch
and a piezoelectric buzzer for the siren along with some wood work from Rich Cooper.

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMJyFkuUDO4

A new version has been requested (by my son) with 4 gates and automated detection of the train passing a specific point
as well as the existing manual button control.

You will need to download and install the following for the python gpio module using the following commands:

$sudo apt-get install python-dev

$sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio

I am pretty new to Python so please excuse any dodgy code and please point out any improvements that could be made.
